## What is Kotlin?

Kotlin is a modern, trending programming language that was released in 2016 by JetBrains.

It has become very popular since it is compatible with Java one of the most popular programming languages out there, which means that Java code and libraries can be used in Kotlin programs.

Kotlin is used for:

- Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
- Web development
- Server side applications
- Data science
- And much, much more!

Furthermore, it supports transparent interoperability between different platforms via its Kotlin Multiplatform Project (Kotlin MPP) feature.

The type system of Kotlin distinguishes at compile time between nullable and non-nullable types, achieving null-safety, i.e., guaranteeing the absence of runtime errors caused by the absence of value (i.e., **null** value).
 Kotlin also extends its static type system with elements of gradual and flow typing, for better interoperability with other languages and ease of development.

Kotlin is an object-oriented language which also has a lot of functional programming elements.
 From the object-oriented side, it supports nominal subtyping with bounded parametric polymorphism (akin to generics) and mixed-site variance.
  From the functional programming side, it has first-class support for higher-order functions and lambda literals.
