### In Java, classes are like blueprints for creating objects. They define the properties (data) and behaviors (methods).


**Syntax:**

```java
class ClassName {  
   <fields>;  
   <constructor>  
   <methods>  
}   
   
```
## Example: A Simple Car Class
```java
class Car {
    // Properties
    String color;
    String model;
    int year;

    // Constructor
    Car(String color, String model, int year) {
        this.color = color;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Methods (functions)
    void startEngine() {
        System.out.println("The engine is starting!");
    }

    void accelerate() {
        System.out.println("The car is speeding up!");
    }
}
```
## Creating Class Objects in java
### After defining the class, you can create instances or objects of that class to access its fields and methods. The new keyword is used to instantiate an object, followed by the class name.

**Syntax:**

```java
ClassName objectName = new ClassName(<arguments>);   
```
* Each object holds its own set of values for the properties defined in its class. For example, a Car object might have a color property set to "red," and another Car object might have it set to "blue."
* Objects can call the methods defined in their class. These methods operate on the object's own data. For example, a Car object might call the startEngine() method to start its engine.
