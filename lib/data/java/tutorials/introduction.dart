# Introduction to Java

Java is a powerful and versatile programming language that has been a cornerstone of software development for decades. It's known for its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy, which means that Java code can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed.

## Key Features

* **Object-Oriented:** Java is built around the concept of objects, which allows for modular and organized code.
* **Platform-Independent:** Thanks to the JVM, Java applications can run on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) without modification.
* **Robust:** Java has strong memory management and error handling, reducing the risk of crashes.
* **Secure:** Java includes security features to protect against malicious code.
* **Large Community:** Java has a massive and active community, providing extensive support and resources for developers.

## Basic Syntax

A simple "Hello, World!" program in Java looks like this:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(Stringargs) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
