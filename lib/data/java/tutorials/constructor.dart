const constructor = '''# Constructors

### A constructor is a special method in Java which has the same name as the class. It is used to initialize an object when it is created. The constructor is automatically called when an object is instantiated.

The syntax is given below.

**Syntax:**

```java
class ClassName {  
    ClassName() {  
        // Initialization code
    }  
}

```

* The constructor name must match the class name exactly.
* Constructors do not have an explicit return type.
