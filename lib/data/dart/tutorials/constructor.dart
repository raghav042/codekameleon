const constructor = ''''## Constructors

### A constructor is a different type of function which is created with same name as its class name. The constructor is used to initialize an object when it is created. When we create the object of class, then constructor is automatically called.

The syntax is given below.

**Syntax:**

```dart
class ClassName {  
     ClassName() {  
}  
}
```

* The constructor name should be same as the class name.
* The constructor doesn't have explicit return type.''';
