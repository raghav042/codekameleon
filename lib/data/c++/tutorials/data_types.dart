const data_types_in_cpp = '''
While writing program in any language, you need to use various variables to store various information. Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.

You may like to store information of various data types like character, wide character, integer, floating point, double floating point, boolean etc. Based on the data type of a variable, the operating system allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory.

Primitive Built-in Types
------------------------

C++ offers the programmer a rich assortment of built-in as well as user defined data types.

Derived Data Types
------------------

Data types which are obtained from pre-defined data types in C++ are known as Derived Data Types.

User-Defined Data Types
-----------------------

Data types which are defined by the user intuitively without using any pre-defined data types are known as User-Defined Data Types.
