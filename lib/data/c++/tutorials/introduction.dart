What is C++?
------------

**C++** is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs. **C++** runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. C++ is an extension of the C programming language with object-oriented programming concepts. Or, we can say, "C++ is a superset of C programming with additional implementation of object-oriented concepts".

Why to Learn C++
----------------

**C++** is an important programming language for students and working professionals to become great software developers. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C++:

*   C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level, which gives you a lot of control in terms of memory management, better performance, and finally, robust software development.
*   **C++ programming** gives you a clear understanding of object-oriented programming. You will understand low level implementation of polymorphism when you implement virtual tables and virtual table pointers, or dynamic type identification.
*   C++ is one of the evergreen programming languages and is loved by millions of software developers. If you are a great C++ programmer, then you will never sit without work, and more importantly, you will get highly paid for your work.
*   C++ is the most widely used programming language in application and system programming. So you can choose your area of interest in software development.
*   C++ really teaches you the difference between compiler, linker, and loader, different data types, storage classes, variable types, their scopes, etc.

There are 1000s of good reasons to learn C++ programming. But one thing is for sure: to learn any programming language, not only C++, you just need to code and code and finally code until you become an expert.

Hello, World! Program Using C++
-------------------------------

Just to give you a little excitement about **C++ programming**, I'm going to give you a small conventional C++ Hello World program, You can try it by clicking on "Edit & Run".

Below is the code to print "Hello World" on the screen −
```

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// main() is where program execution begins.
int main() {
   cout << "Hello, World!"; // prints Hello, World!
   return 0;
}

```
Features of C++
---------------

The following are the features of C++ programming language −

*   **C language compatibility**: C++ provides backward compatibility with C; it supports all features of C language.
*   **Object-oriented programming**: C++ supports the concepts of OOPs such as objects & classes, encapsulation, data binding, inheritance, and polymorphism.
*   **Compiled language:** C++ is a compiler language where the complete code is converted into machine language, which makes it a faster programming language.
*   **Standard template library:** C++ provides many data structures and algorithms-related library collections, such as template libraries for contains, iterators, algorithms, etc.
*   **Dynamic memory management**: C++ provides two operators new and delete that help to allocate and deallocate memory blocks dynamically.
*   **Exception handling**: C++ provides try, catch, and throw blocks for exceptional handling, which were not available in C programming.

Applications of C++ Programming
-------------------------------

As mentioned before, C++ is one of the most widely used programming languages. It has its presence in almost every area of software development. I'm going to list a few of them here:

*   **Application Software Development** - C++ programming has been used in developing almost all the major Operating Systems like Windows, Mac OSX and Linux. Apart from the operating systems, the core part of many browsers, like Mozilla Firefox and Chrome have been written using C++. C++ also has been used in developing the most popular database system called MySQL.
*   **Programming Languages Development** - C++ has been used extensively in developing new programming languages like C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, UNIX's C Shell, PHP, Python, and Verilog, etc.
*   **Computation Programming** - C++ is the best friend of scientists because of its fast speed and computational efficiencies.
*   **Games Development** - C++ is extremely fast, which allows programmers to do procedural programming for CPU-intensive functions and provides greater control over hardware, because of which it has been widely used in the development of gaming engines.
*   **Embedded System** - C++ is being heavily used in developing medical and engineering applications like software for MRI machines, high-end CAD/CAM systems, etc.

This list goes on. There are various areas where software developers are happily using C++ to provide great software.
