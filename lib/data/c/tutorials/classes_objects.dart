### In C, we don't have classes like in object-oriented languages, but we can use structures to group related data and functions to operate on them. This simulates a class-like behavior.

**Syntax:**

```c
struct StructName {
   <fields>;
};
### Example: A Simple Car Structure

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

// Define the structure
struct Car {
  char color[20];
  char model[20];
  int year;
};

// Functions operating on Car
void startEngine() {
    printf("The engine is starting!\\n");
}

void accelerate() {
    printf("The car is speeding up!\\n");
}
```

### Creating Struct Objects in C
After defining the structure, we can create instances (objects) of the structure and access their fields. We do not use a new keyword like in other languages.

```C
struct StructName object_name;
```

* Each object (struct variable) holds its own set of values for the fields defined in the structure.
* Functions that operate on these structures are written separately and usually take the struct as an argument if needed.
