# Error Handling in C: Using setjmp and longjmp

### In C, try-catch blocks are not built-in as they are in languages like Dart. However, you can simulate exception handling using `setjmp` and `longjmp` functions. 

What are **Exceptions**?
* Exceptions are errors that arise during program execution. They can be caused by various factors like division by zero, accessing an invalid memory location, or network issues.
* If not handled properly, exceptions can cause the program to crash or behave unpredictably.

## Simulating Try-Catch in C using setjmp/longjmp

The `setjmp` function saves the program state, and `longjmp` allows the program to jump back to that saved state when an error occurs.

---

**Syntax:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <setjmp.h>

jmp_buf env;

void cause_error() {
    // Simulating an error
    longjmp(env, 1);  // Jump back to the setjmp call with a return value of 1
}

int main() {
    if (setjmp(env) != 0) {
        // This block acts like the catch block
        printf("An exception occurred!\n");
    } else {
        // This block acts like the try block
        cause_error(); // This will trigger longjmp and jump to the catch block
    }
    return 0;
}
```
### Key Points:
* setjmp: Saves the program state for potential future jumps.
* longjmp: Jumps back to the point where setjmp was called, effectively simulating exception handling.

### Limitations:
* C does not support full-fledged exception handling like other modern languages (e.g., Dart, Java).
* The setjmp/longjmp mechanism is not as intuitive and flexible as the try-catch block in languages that natively support exceptions.
