### In JavaScript, classes are blueprints for creating objects. They define the properties (data) and behaviors (functions).

**Syntax:**

```javascript
class ClassName {  
   constructor() {  
     // Initialize properties
   }  
   <methods>  
}   
```

### Example: A Simple Car Class
```javascript 
class Car {
  // Properties
  constructor(color, model, year) {
    this.color = color;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }

  // Methods (functions)
  startEngine() {
    console.log("The engine is starting!");
  }

  accelerate() {
    console.log("The car is speeding up!");
  }
}
```

### Creating Class Objects in JavaScript

After creating the class, we can create an instance or object of that class to access its fields and functions. The new keyword is used to declare a class followed by the class name.

Syntax:
```javascript 
let objectName = new ClassName(parameters);    
```
* Each object holds its own set of values for the properties defined in its class. For example, a Car object might have a color property set to "red" and another Car object might have it set to "blue."
* Objects can call the methods defined in their class. These methods operate on the object's own data.
