const constructor = '''# Constructors in JavaScript

### A constructor is a special function used to initialize an object when it is created. When we create an instance of a class, the constructor is automatically called to set up the initial values for the object.

The syntax is given below.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
class ClassName {  
     constructor() {  
        // initialization code  
     }  
}
```

* The constructor name should be same as the class name.
* The constructor doesn't have explicit return type.
