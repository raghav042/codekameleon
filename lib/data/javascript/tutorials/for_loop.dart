# Making Decisions in JavaScript: Mastering the if and else Statements

### Understanding if and else statements is crucial for controlling the flow of your JavaScript programs and making informed decisions based on specific conditions. This guide will delve into their syntax, usage, and practical applications.

*The if Statement: Taking Action When Conditions Are Met*

**Syntax:**

```javascript
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

### Example:

```javascript
let age = 25;
if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
}
```
* The if statement checks if the condition (age >= 18) is true.
* If the condition is true, the code inside the if block gets executed.
