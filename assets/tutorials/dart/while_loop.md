## While Loop

### While loops are used for automating repetitive tasks within your code. They allow you to execute a block of code multiple times, as long as a specific condition remains true. This saves you time and effort compared to manually writing the code repeatedly.


**Syntax:**

```dart
while(condition){  
      //statement(s);  
      // Increment (++) or Decrement (--) Operation;  
}  
```
